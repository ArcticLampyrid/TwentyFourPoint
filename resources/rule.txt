============24-Point Game Instructions============
1. Players must set a nickname before starting the game.
2. In the menu interface, players can select difficulty, check the rank, or view the game rules (you are here).
       Difficulty: Easy (45s per question, score 3 points), Medium (36s per question, score 4 points), Hard (28s per question, score 5 points), Endless (28s per question, score 5 points)
3. After choosing the game difficulty, players can start the game (in Normal mode, each round consists of 3 questions; in Infinite mode, there is no limit).
   (1) Once the game starts, it will randomly generate four numbers. Players need to respond within the allotted time (determined by the chosen difficulty level).
       ① If the numbers given by the game can make 24, the player needs to enter an expression that results in 24, using only the operations +, -, ×, ÷, and parentheses can be used.
           For example: If the game gives four numbers 3, 3, 6, 2, the player needs to enter the expression (3+3-2)*6. The program checks if the operation is successful before moving on to the next round
       ② If the four numbers given by the game cannot make 24, the player needs to enter NO.
           For example: If the game gives the numbers 1, 2, 1, 3, which cannot make 24, the player needs to enter NO to move on to the next round
   (2) In each round of answering questions, correct answers are scored according to the chosen difficulty level; if the player answers incorrectly or fails to answer within the time limit, the round ends immediately and the total score is recorded.
